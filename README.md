wow! finally me and mehran (special thank to dear mehran for his great work on this project) finished this very cool project.
Lets describe project:
in fact this projects is a social network in which users are allowed to post(or maybe tweet :|) about films which provided for them. yes! films are provided in this social network and each film has a profile page contains film info such as: cover, imdb link , director , writer , actors, synopsis, review and so on. now user can write his post about a film in its profile page. then this post will apear in user profile page and also users followers time line!
like most common social networks these features are available: follow or unfollow users , comment on a post , like or dislike posts and comments.
<h2>Impelementaion:</h2>
Technically we implemented this web application in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">python django web framework</a>.
as repository file structure shows our web application has belwo apps:
<ul>
<li>
comments : for commentaion! system! users can comment on posts.
</li>
<li>
films : app for manage films.
</li>
<li>
notifications : users activity notification.
</li>
<li>
posts : users posts are included in this app.
</li>
<li>
search : since search among users and films cant be in other apps we start an app for this task! 
</li>
<li>
users : user management app.
</li>
<li>
film_networks : the last app which manage all other apps functionality! to works together properly.
</li>
</ul>
As soon as mehran finds free time he will deploy the project to access his country people to this project and have fun in this cool social network.
And its address will be : <a href="http://inbitera.com">http://inbitera.com</a>
